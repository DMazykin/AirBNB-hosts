# AirBnB Hosts - Udacity Blog post project 
by Denis Mazykin

## Motivation:

In this project, I going to use Airbnb data from [Inside AirBnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) in order to find out how hosts impact on guests? And how this knowledge can to improve our experience from a trip.

Based on my experience with Airbnb, I posted several question, which I'm going to investigate in this project:
- What is the structure of hosts? How varying is it in different city?
- Does it really important how many of listings a host owns? Is there any impact on clients impression (rating)?
- Are reviews correlating with the hostâ€™s type?

## Results:

- The structure of hosts by number of listings they have if different from city to city. In Italy, Airbnb used more by professionals or some people have a lot of apartments to rent out, while in Norway of France (Paris) it is not a common practice. 
- In spite of the different structure, guests tend to apprise host others and write more reviews for hosts with a single apartment. But this is not valid for hosts, which rent out their property just occasionally.
